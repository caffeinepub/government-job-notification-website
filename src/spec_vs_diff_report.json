  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented in the auth hook via an exact string comparison against the new password. Changes required in ClientAdminPage.tsx for special-character input handling (REQ-2) are not evidenced in the provided diff summary. Several unrelated project/documentation state updates were also made that are not part of the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the Client Admin login password input accepts special characters (including @, #, &, *, and :) and submits them unchanged for authentication comparison.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no changes to the password input page (frontend/src/pages/ClientAdminPage.tsx) and provides no evidence that input handling avoids trimming/sanitization or that special characters are accepted and passed unchanged into useClientAdminAuth.login().",
