  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented via a dedicated admin-auth loading screen and an updated Access Denied UX. Backend changes add a one-time access control initialization path and persist an initialization flag via migration, but the diff does not clearly show an explicit post-bootstrap admin management API, nor does it document a testable bootstrap procedure or demonstrate that job post CRUD now succeeds for an admin.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add an explicit admin bootstrap/management API that can be invoked safely to grant admin to a principal, with strict access control to prevent privilege escalation (and provide a documented/testable way to bootstrap at least one admin after deployment).",
      "reason": "The backend adds a one-time `initializeAccessControl` entrypoint and a migration flag (`isAccessControlInitialized`), but the diff does not show an explicit admin grant/management API (e.g., grant/revoke admin for a target principal) beyond one-time initialization, nor any documentation/instructions demonstrating a testable bootstrap flow. Additionally, the diff is truncated and does not provide evidence that admin-gated job post CRUD succeeds once admin is granted.",
