# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a prominent, site-wide scrolling notice/ticker in the shared header that continuously displays an English daily-update message and remains readable on mobile.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a marquee-style ticker/notice bar to the shared header layout so it appears on all routes (including the homepage and post detail pages).
- Implement continuous left-to-right or right-to-left scrolling animation with an English message (e.g., “No need to update — visit here daily for new updates.”).
- Ensure the ticker is mobile-friendly (readable, not clipped, adequate contrast) and does not interfere with the existing sticky header behavior or cause content to be hidden behind the header.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a continuously scrolling notice at the top of the site on all pages telling them they don’t need to update and to visit daily for new updates.
